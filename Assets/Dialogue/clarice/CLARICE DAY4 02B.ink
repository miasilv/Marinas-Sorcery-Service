 Hello again, Marina. #speaker:Clarice #layout:left

 How does your work go?

 Good! I've also got your potion for you. #speaker: Marina #layout:right

 It's not too strong in taste either.

 Oh, you are such a dear! Thank you. #speaker:Clarice #layout:left

 I'll finally be able to finish that book now.

 Let me know how it ends. #speaker: Marina #layout:right

 I will, Marina. I'll even let you read it once I finish. #speaker:Clarice #layout:left
